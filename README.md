This is my personal developer portfolio — a modern, responsive single-page application built with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **shadcn/ui**. It showcases my projects and skills in a simple and clean layout.

The site is deployed via **GitHub Pages**, making it easy to share with recruiters, collaborators, and the dev community.
